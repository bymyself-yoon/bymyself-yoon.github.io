Hello! I am Son Suyun, majoring in computer engineering at Dong-A University.

I belong to my 40s seulA computer engineering student council.

I am working hard on [Blogs][blogs] and [Instagram][instagram]. I also put up a repertoire on [Python][python_github] and [c/cpp][cpp_github] on GitHub, so please come and visit.

Thank you for watching!
